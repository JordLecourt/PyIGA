Island Genetic Algorithm implementation in python.

The advantage of island GA, compared to standard GA is that evolving separated populations can prevent falling in a local maximum.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or : 

`pip install -r numpy`

## Features
PyIGA is also suited for binary integer programming, for which it was originally designed.
